### Problem and Solution ###
Imagine you are a budding new business owner and you are trying to market your product to customers in your area. As a new establishment, you are still trying to build your brand by selling your high quality product to enthusiastic consumers. However, paying for marketing on your local radio station or billboards is costly and does not reach the target demographic. As a new business, you want to reach customers who are known to be enthusiastic about the culture surrounding your product. 

### Previous Works ####
The market for data scraping is huge as many advertisements are geared towards target audiences. Without data scraping, businesses wouldn't have an idea of where to start their pitch. Some applications that use data scraping are:
[1] Supermetrics and
[2] WebScraper.

### Intended Usage and Environment ###
DataScrapers will be ran on popular social media platforms (Tiktok, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to retrieve username handles and data. The client will then use these handles to reach out to target customers and market their business. 

### Our High-Level Plan and Approach ###
Data Scraper will identify the client’s target consumer(s) and recommend most effective marketing strategies to ensure the client receives maximum engagement. Data Scraper will discover potential consumers via scanning for tags or captions on social media sites that have relevant keywords in regards to the client’s product. Then, Data Scraper will compile a list of username handles from a social media platform that the client can use to send their social media campaign to. Data Scraper will also recommend a type of social media campaign (i.e. Instagram story, tweet, etc.) that should be used to target certain demographics. For example, if the product is applicable for middle-aged or older people, Data Scraper would likely recommend Facebook or Youtube. If the product is aimed towards younger people, then Data Scraper would likely recommend Tiktok, Snapchat, and Instagram. The client can choose which recommendations to take and kickstart their marketing campaign!

### Functionality ###
What better way to reach those consumers than by using the DataScrappers bayesian approach in targeting valuable customers. DataScrappers uses a probabilistic approach where data is gathered on enthusiastic customers who have self selected themselves to be a valued customer of your product.

### User Operations ###
* The user is the client hoping to determine their business’s target consumer base and receive an effective marketing strategy to reach those consumers. 
* When the user first boots up Data Scraper, they are brought to a sign-up screen where they can create an account for their business. 
* After signing up, they are brought to the home screen of Data Scraper where they input the mission statement of the business, the product(s), and the background information of the business (i.e. office address, business size). 
* After entering enough information, Data Scraper will pick out demographics that match the business and product descriptions and allow the client to choose which demographics to target. 
* After the client determines which demographic to develop a marketing campaign for, Data Scraper will recommend a social media campaign targeted towards social media users that match those demographics. 
* The client will then review the social media campaign details and confirm if they feel like the recommendations are fitting. 
* Then, they can apply our recommendations to their marketing strategy and execute the social media campaign.
